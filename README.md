This project simulates Bayesian inference for a hidden market regime.
The market state *(Bull/Bear)* is unobservable, while price movements
*(Up/Down)* are noisy observations.

The simulation demonstrates:
- Sequential Bayesian updating
- Effect of signal strength
- Role of priors in inference

This model is a simplified version of regime detection used in
quantitative trading systems.
